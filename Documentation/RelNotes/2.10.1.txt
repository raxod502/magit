Magit v2.10.1 Release Notes
===========================

Fixes since v2.10.0
-------------------

* When multiple stashes were selected by the region, responding "no"
  when asked to confirm the deletion of these stashes resulted in a
  type error.  #2917

* When committing inside a repository that was created using `git
  init --separate-git-dir', the diff buffer was empty, instead of
  showing the changes about to be committed.  For some reason that
  git command, unlike other commands that do essentially the same
  thing, does not set `core.worktree', which confused Magit.  #2955

* In the repository list buffer, the columns that are supposed to list
  unpushed and unpulled commit counts, were blank.  #2960
